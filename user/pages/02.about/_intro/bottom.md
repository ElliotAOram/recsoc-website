## CSSC Membership

Civil Service Sports Council (CSSC) membership of one kind or another is open to all members of staff, whether permanent, on contracts or short term stays, e.g. students. Membership for 2018 costs just £4.25 per month which is paid by direct debit.

As a member of CSSC you are entitled to full use of all our local clubs and facilities, most of which are located in R58 (The building next to the large dish). The Rec-Soc has a lounge and bar open every lunch time and on occasional evenings with refreshments at discounted prices. We host lunchtime quizzes and competitions, such as crib, chess, backgammon, darts, Aunt Sally and pool, and other functions at regular intervals.

As a full CSSC member you also qualify for a massive number of National, Regional and Local benefits. CSSC organise annual programmes of Regional and National sport and leisure events covering a huge range of activities. Locally from the Oxford Area, we run regular trips to sports and social events during the year.  Typical trips include, Royal Ascot, The Great British Beer Festival, Twickenham, shopping days to Bath, York, and Bournemouth, plus theatre trips to the West End and other local theatres.

Cheap cinema tickets can be purchased directly from CSSC which represent almost half price savings on peak time cinema prices. All major cinema chains are included and tickets prices start at £5.25 for Adult tickets.  Additionally CSSC members receive automatic membership of the Countdown discount scheme which offers local and national discounts on a massive range of products and covers many of the larger shopping chains such as Sainsbury's Asda, Halfords, B&Q etc. The discounts for each shop vary from 4% up to 20% and above. Discounted tickets are often available for popular events including Goodwood Revival, Festival Of Speed, Fairford Royal International Air Tattoo, and Abingdon Air Show and we also run a season ticket scheme for Oxford United Football Club.

Once a member of CSSC, it is also possible to sign your partner or family members up for linked membership (at the same price per month) so they receive the same discounts on any trips you might attend together.
