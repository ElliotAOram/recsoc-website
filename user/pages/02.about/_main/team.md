## The RecSoc Committee

The Recreational Society is governed by an elected Committee of volunteers that consist of the Chairman, the Vice-Chairman, the Honorary General Secretary, the Honorary Treasurer, and twelve additional members
elected annually from among Full Members of the Society at the Annual General Meeting.

The Committee meet once a month and are responsible for the management of the Society's rules, membership, facilities, income and expenditure, licences, and liaison with RAL Management and Estates. Copies of the Minutes of the Committee meetings and AGMs are available to any member of the Society.
