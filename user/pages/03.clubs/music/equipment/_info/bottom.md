Music Club members store their own instruments/equipment in the Music Room, and as a common courtesy you should seek the permission of the owner before using their gear. Please get in touch with the <a href="mailto:tristan.youngs@stfc.ac.uk">club chairman</a> if you want to locate the owner of a particular piece of equipment. Equally, if you want to leave a piece of your gear in the room long-term then you must get in touch with the club secretary <a href="mailto:ronnie.brumfitt@stfc.ac.uk">Ronnie Brumfitt</a> to let him know it's there, as well as its value, otherwise it will not be covered by our insurance.

The club does own some of the gear in the room, and which is listed below.
