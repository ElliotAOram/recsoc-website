# Booking the Music Room

## Booking Policy
Bookings are currently made by inviting the [Music Room Outlook calendar](mailto:r58mscrm@stfc.ac.uk) to an appointment, which our secretary will then receive and accept / reject accordingly. Repeat / recurring bookings are permitted, but please restrict these to 4 - 6 weeks so as to allow bookings at peak times (e.g. lunchtimes) to be spread between all the members.

## Usage Rules
The Music Room exists to satisfy the needs of many different types of user, so please bear this in mind when using it. In particular:
- Ensure that all equipment is turned off at the wall before leaving.
- Tidy away any gear that you use - this includes neatly storing cables away (rather than just dumping them on top of the nearest amp cabinet).
- Take your rubbish with you (e.g. empty soft drink cans, old guitar strings, old setlists with footprints on etc.)
- Respect other people's equipment - a lot of the gear in the room does not belong to the club, but is someone's personal possession. Some equipment is available for general use (see the [list on the equipment page](/clubs/music/equipment)) but please leave it as you found it. 

## Noise Pollution
We ask users to moderate the volume of "output" from the Music Room under the following conditions:
- If there is a Table Tennis League or Cup match in the Table Tennis room. These are usually held on week nights and we ask that noise is kept to a polite level (i.e. no loud amplifiers or acoustic drumming) beyond 19:30. A list of known table tennis fixtures can be found on the wall in the Music Room itself, and the calendar usually contains markers to indicate known upcoming fixtures.
- If there is a quiet activity / class being held in the adjacent Sports Hall (e.g. yoga or pilates classes).
