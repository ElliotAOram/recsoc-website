# Lessons

The club offers music lessons on-site through accredited teachers. See below for what is currently available, and what is currently at the "discussion" stage.

Most tutors offer a free taster lession / session for which you do not need to be a member of the Music Club or the RecSoc. However, if you decide to take regular lessons then you'll need to be a [member of the RecSoc](/join) as well as the [Music Club](/clubs/music/join).

If you have any questions, suggesions / requests for other types of lessons, or wish to arrange a trial / regular lessons, please email<a href="mailto:tristan.youngs@stfc.ac.uk?subject=Lessons / RAL Music Club">the chairman</a>. 

## Piano

Piano lessons are currently held every Thursday from 10:00 - 14:30 in the Music Room, held by Becky Watts. She teaches from beginner upwards, and can help you work towards examinations and festivals.
Check out [her prospectus](/clubs/music/lessons/Becky_Watts_Prospectus.pdf) for more information and pricing, and get in touch with her directly if you want to check for lesson availability.

## Guitar

Our guitar teacher Hugh Turner holds lessons every Tuesday. He is a professional musician who's been teaching students for over 20 years, covering a range of styles such as jazz, pop, and rock, on both acoustic and electric guitar. Hugh teaches any level, from beginners who've never picked up a guitar through to advanced players wanting to hone their skills.

Lessons can be one-on-one or taken as a group. Prices are £40 per hour (less for group lessons).

## Sax / Clarinet

Rob Digweed teaches both sax and clarinet on alternate Wednesdays. He has travelled the world playing in a range of ensembles - orchestras, brass bands, big bands etc. - and has played alongside some of the best jazz musicians in the UK. 

## Ukulele

We will be holding a group taster session on Monday March 23rd in the RecSoc Lounge. Thereafter, there will be a 10-week course starting mid-April (after the Easter holidays). The course will be £60 for the ten lessons. Following on from that, we hope to have regular ukulele group sessions.

# In Discussion

## Singing

We are presently engaging with several local singing coaches to try and establish regular lessons at the club, for individuals or groups.

## Flute

We are also actively looking for a local flute teacher after expressions of interest from our members.
