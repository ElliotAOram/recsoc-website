## Booking policy
Courts can be booked for personal use by any RALTC members. This can be done via the outlook calendar (see details below).
We ask that you book the courts for no more than an hour at a time, and avoid excessive numbers of booking per week if the courts are busy.
Please do not book at the same time as an official session. Sessions are normally very busy and you will be very unlikely to get a court.


## Court Rules
* When arriving, turn the padlock to the correct combination and release the lock by pulling the silver metal vertically.
* If the courts are in use when you arrive, make yourself known, but please allow players time to finish their current game.
* Avoid walking behind courts whilst the ball is in play as to not obstruct play, or put players off.
* Feel free to make use of the balls and equipment in the storage unit on court
* Once you have finished your session please:
  * Wind the net down so it is slack - to avoid damage to the net
  * Put any club owned items you have used back in the storage unit neatly
  * If you are the last player on court, reattach the padlock to the gate and change the code to a random set of numbers
