## Facilities
The Rutherford Appleton Laboratory tennis courts are located adjacent to (and accessible from) the south car park of the labs.
There is currently one functional court and a storage container with spare rackets and balls that are kept on the courts.
These resources are free to use for all members. There is a number combination required to access the courts.
The combination is given to all members upon joining, and is changed each year.
